## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Database configured
2. ✅ Tables created
3. ✅ Environment variables set
4. ✅ Dev server running

### Optional Improvements

#### A. Create Additional Storage Buckets
Navigate to your Supabase dashboard → Storage:

1. **Create "avatars" bucket:**
   - Name: `avatars`
   - Public: Yes
   - File size limit: 2MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp`

2. **Create "project-files" bucket:**
   - Name: `project-files`
   - Public: No (private)
   - File size limit: 10MB

#### B. Configure Storage Policies
For the `avatars` bucket:
```sql
-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public Access" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated Upload" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

-- Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Own Avatar Update" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'avatars' 
    AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

#### C. Test Application Features
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Test user registration
3. Test user login
4. Test profile creation
5. Test project creation
6. Test search functionality

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Could not find the table in schema cache"
- **Solution:** This is a temporary caching issue on first connection. Refresh the page or make another query.

**Issue:** Storage upload fails
- **Solution:** Ensure storage buckets are created and policies are set.

**Issue:** Authentication redirect fails
- **Solution:** Check that the site URL is configured in Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration.
